# Malware-Detection
This study introduces a versatile framework designed to distinguish between malware files and clean files using machine learning algorithms. It highlights the growing challenge of detecting malware due to its polymorphic nature and the limitations of traditional signature-based methods. The approach proposes the utilization of machine learning techniques to address this issue, specifically focusing on cascade one-sided perceptrons and kernelized variants. The study aims to minimize false positives while achieving accurate malware detection.
